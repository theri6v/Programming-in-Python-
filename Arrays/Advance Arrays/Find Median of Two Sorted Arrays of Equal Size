Here, on this page, we will discuss the program to find the Median of two sorted arrays of equal size in the Python programming language. We are given two arrays say arr1[ ] and arr2[ ] of the same size say n. We need to find the median after merging these arrays.

Example :

Input : arr1 = [ 1, 12, 15, 26, 38 ],  arr2 = [ 2, 13, 17, 30, 45 ]
Output : 16
Explanation : After merging and sorting the array it will be [ 1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45 ], middle elements are 15 and 17 so, median of the given array will be ((15+17)/2) = 16
Median of two sorted arrays of equal size in Python

Algorithm
After merging both arrays and sorting them send it to the function to find median
If the length of the array is even then find the floor value of l divided by 2 and store it in medium
Set median equals to sum of (array[medium] and array[medium-1]) divided by 2
return median
Else set medium equals to ceil(l/2) and return array[medium -1]


Python Code

from math import ceil


def median_of_two_arrays(l, array):
    if (l % 2) == 0:
        medium = l // 2
        median = (array[medium] + array[medium - 1]) / 2
        return median
    else:
        medium = ceil(l / 2)
        return array[medium - 1]


array1 = [1, 12, 15, 26, 38]
array2 = [2, 13, 17, 30, 45]

print("Array after merging and sorting :", end="")
array1 += array2
array1.sort()
print(array1)
ans = median_of_two_arrays(len(array1), array1)
print("Median :", int(ans))


Output
Array after merging and sorting :[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]
Median : 16
