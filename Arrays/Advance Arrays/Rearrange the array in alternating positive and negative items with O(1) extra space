Here, on this page will learn how to solve Rearrange the array in alternating positive and negative items with O(1) extra space in Python programing language. In O(n) time complexity.

Example:

Input :  [ 7, 5, -2, 1, -3 ]
Output :  [ -2, 5, -3, 1, 7 ]
Rearrange the array in Python

Algorithm
Initialize two variable p, b with value 0
Run a for loop from 0 to length of array using variable i
For each iteration if b is equals to 1 then make b equals to -1
else if arr[i] is less then zero
Swap values of arr[i] & arr[p]
If p is greater then i increment the value of b by 1
Increment value of p by 2
After loop ends print arr
Time And Space Complexity :
Time – Complexity : O(N)
Space – Complexity : O(1)

Python Program to rearrange array

def rearrange(arr):
    p = 0
    b = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if b == 1:
            b -= 1
        elif arr[i] < 0:
            arr[i], arr[p] = arr[p], arr[i]
            if p > i:
                b += 1
            p += 2
    return arr


array = [2, 3, -4, -1, 6, -9]
print("After Rearranging :", rearrange(array))
