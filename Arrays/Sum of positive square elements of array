Here we will learn about Sum of positive square elements of array.

For this program, we need to find the square of every element and add all these square elements.

Example
Input:       1 2 3 4 5

Square:     1 4 9 16 25

sum:        1+4+9+16+25=55

now we will see the working of program and java program of the square sum of elements.

Square sum
Working
Step 1. Initialize arrays.

Step 2. Declare the scanner class for taking input.

Step 3. take array size from the user.

Step 4. Take an element of the array from the user.

Step 5.  Print the return value of the function SquareSum.

SquareSum(int a[], int size)

Step 1. Initialise two-variable sum and square with zero.

Step 2.  Declare loop from zero to size.

Step 3.  Inside the loop calculate the square of every element.

Step 4.  Inside the loop calculate the sum, add the sum with a square.

Step 5. Return sum.

Python

n=int(input(“Enter size array1 “))
arr1=[]
print(“enter element”)
for i in range(n):
    arr1.append(int(input()))
s=0
for i in arr1:
    s+=i*i 
print(s)

Output
enter size 
4
enter element
1
2
3
4
square sum of element 30
