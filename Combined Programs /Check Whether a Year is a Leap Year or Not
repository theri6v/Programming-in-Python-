Given an integer input as the year, the objective is to Check if a Year is a Leap Year or Not in Python Language. To do so we’ll check each condition mentioned below in the blue box. It either of the conditions is satisfied, the year is a leap year. It’s not otherwise. Here are some methods to check whether or not it’s a leap year

Method 1: Using if-else statements 1
Method 2: Using if-else statements 2
Method 3 : Using Ternary Operator
Method 4 : Using Calendar Mode
Method 5 : Using Lamda Function
We’ll discuss all the above mentioned methods in detail in the upcoming sections. Before going for the approach read out the blue box below for better understanding of the concept.

Conditions for a Leap Year
Here are the two conditions that any year must satisfy to be called a leap year 
1. The year must be perfectly divisible by 400.
2. The number must be divisible by 4 but not by 100.

**Method 1: Using if-else Statements 1
In this method we’ll use the if-else statements to check whether or not the input integer satisfies either of the conditions. To learn more about control statements in python, check out if-else control statements in Python.

Working
For a User Input year we do

Check if the year variable is divisible by 400.
Check if the year variable is divisible only by 4 and not 100.
If the above mentioned conditions are satisfied, prints “Leap Year”, print “Not a Leap Year” otherwise.
Let’s implement the above logic in Python Language.

Python Code

year = 2000

if (year%400 == 0) or (year%4==0 and year%100!=0):
    print("Leap Year")
else:
    print("Not a Leap Year")

Output
Leap Year

**Method 2: Using if-else Statements 2
In this method we’ll use the if-else statements to check whether or not the input integer satisfies either of the conditions. This method is a modified and simpler version of the previous method.

Working
For a User Input year we do

The input is stored in an int type variable say year.
year is checked for being a leap year or not with the following condition if( ((year % 4 == 0)&&(year % 100 != 0)) || (year % 400==0) )
If the above condition is true then input is a leap year otherwise input is not a leap year.
Let’s implement the above logic in Python Language.

Python Code

year = 2000
if( ((year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0)) or (year % 400==0) ):
    print("Leap Year")
else:
    print("Not leap Year")

Output:
Leap Year

**Method 3: Using Ternary Operator
In this method we’ll use ternary operator in Python

Python Code

def check_leap(year): 
    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0) 

year = int(input("Enter a year: ")) 

print(f"{year} is leap year" if check_leap(year) else f"{year} is not leap year")

**Method 4: Using Calendar Module
In this method we’ll use calendar mode in python

Python Code

import calendar

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if calendar.isleap(year):
    print(year, " is a leap year")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year.")


**Method 5: Using Lamda Function
In this method we’ll use lamda function in python


is_leap_year = lambda year: (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if is_leap_year(year):
    print(year, " is a leap year")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year.")
