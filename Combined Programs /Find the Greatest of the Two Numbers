Given two integer inputs, the objective is to find the largest number among the two integer inputs. In order to do so we usually use if-else statements to check which one’s greater. Here are some of the Python methods to solve the above mentioned problem.

Method 1: Using if-else Statements
Method 2: Using Ternary Operator
Method 3: Using inbuilt max() Function
We’ll discuss the above mentioned methods in detail in the upcoming sections.


**Method 1: Using if-else Statements
In this method we’ll find the Largest Number using simple if-else statements.

Working
For the two integer inputs num1 and num2

Check if num1>num2, print num1 if true.
Print num2 otherwise.
Let’s implement the above logic in Python Language.

Python Code
Run
num1, num2 = 20 , 30
if num1>num2:
  print(num1)
else:
  print(num2)

Output
30

**Method 2: Using Ternary Operator
In this method we’ll use Ternary Operator in Python to find the Largest Number among the two input integers.

Working
Given the integer inputs num1 and num2

Check if num1>num2 using ternary operator in python.
print num1 if true or num2 otherwise.
Let’s implement the above logic in Python Language.

Python Code
Run
num1, num2 = 20 , 30
print((num1 if num1>num2 else num2))
Output
30

**Method 3: Using inbuilt max() Function
In this method we’ll use the inbuilt max() function that take two integers as arguments and returns the largest among them.

Working
Given two input numbers num1 and num2

Call inbuilt max() function with num1 and num2 as arguments.
Print the returned value.
Let’s implement the above logic in Python Language.

Python Code
Run
num1, num2 = 20, 30
print(max(num1,num2))
Output
30
