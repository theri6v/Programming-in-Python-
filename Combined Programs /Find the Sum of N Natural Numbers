Given an integer value the objective of the code is to sum up all the numbers until the input integer number. To do so we usually use iteration, we iterate through the numbers until the input number is reached while appending the number to the sum variable. Here are some methods to solve the above mentioned problem

Method 1: Using for Loop
Method 2: Using Formula
Method 3: Using Recursion
We’ll discuss the above methods in detail in the sections below.

**Method 1: Using for Loop
In this method we’ll use for loops to iterate through all the numbers until the integer input “number” is reached.

Working
For an integer input “number” we do the following

Initialize the required variables.
Using for loop iterate from 0 to number+1.
Meanwhile append the number to sum variable.
Print the sum variable.
Let’s implement the above logic in Python code.

Python Code
number,sum = 6,0
for i in range(number+1):
  sum+=i
print(sum)

Output
21

**Method 2: Using the Formula
In this method we’ll use the formula for finding the sum of N integers in a series from series and sequences i.e sum = number * ( number + 1 ) / 2 to calculate the sum until the given integer input.

Working
For an integer input “number”  we perform the following steps

Initialize sum variable as sum = (number * ( number + 1 ) /2 ).
Print the sum variable.
Let’s implement the above logic in Python Language.

Python Code
number = 6
sum = int((number * (number + 1))/2)
print(sum)
Output
21

**Method 3: Using Recursion
In this method we’ll use recursion to recursively iterate through the number while appending them to the sum variable until the number is reach which here act as the base case. To learn more about recursion, check out Recursion in Python.

Working
For an integer input “number” we do

Initialize the required variables.
Define a recursive function with base case as number ==0.
Set the step recursive call as number + recursum( number – 1 ).
Call the recursive function recursum() and print the returned value.
Let’s implement the above logic using Python Language.

Python Code
def recursum(number):
  if number == 0:
    return number
  return number + recursum(number-1)
number, sum = 6,0
print(recursum(number))

Output
21
