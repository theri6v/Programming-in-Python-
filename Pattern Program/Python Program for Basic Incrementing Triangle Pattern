In this Python Program, we will be discussing how to write a program to print Basic Incrementing Triangle Pattern. In this pattern, there are n numbers of rows are present which are entered by the user. We will use the ‘k’ variable which is initially initialized by 3 for printing number increasing order. With every iteration of for loop, we will increase the k variable by 1. So, Users have to enter a single value, that will be determined as a number of rows and columns of the pattern. With the help of “for loop”, we will print the Basic Incrementing Triangle Pattern.

Python Program for Basic Incrementing Triangle Pattern
Working:
Step 1. Start

Step 2. Take number of rows as input from the user and stored it into num.

Step 3. Take a variable ‘k’ and initialize it as 3.

Step 4. Run a loop ‘i’ number of times to iterate through all the rows which is Starting from i=0 to num.

Step 5. Run a nested loop inside the main loop for printing spaces which is starting from j=0 to i+i.

Step 6. Print ‘k’ inside the nested loop for each row.

Step 7. Outside the Second for loop, Increase k variable by 1.

Step 8. Move to the next line by printing a new line using print() function.

Stop 9. Stop

Python Program:

num = int(input("Enter the Number: "))
k = 3

for i in range(0, num):
    for j in range(0, i+1):
        print(k, end="")
    k = k + 1
    print()
