In this Python Program, we will be discussing about how to write a program to print Incrementing Number Square Pattern. In this pattern, there are n*n rows and columns are present. This pattern follows number increment order in square form. So, User have to enter a single value, that will be determine as a number of rows and columns of the pattern. With the help of “for loop”, we will print the Incrementing Number Square Pattern.

Python Program for Printing Incrementing Number Square Pattern
Working:
Step 1. Start

Step 2. Take number of rows as input from the user and stored it into num.

Step 3. Run a for loop starting from 1 to user entered num+1 value.

Step 4. Inside for loop, Run another for loop starting from 0 to num as well.

Step 5. Print ‘i’ inside the nested loop for each row.

Step 6. Move to the next line by printing a new line using print() function.

Stop 7. Stop

Python Program:
num = int(input("Enter the Number: "))

for i in range(1, num+1):
    for j in range(0, num):
        print(i, end="")
    print()
