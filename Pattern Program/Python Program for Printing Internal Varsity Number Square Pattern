In this Python Program, we will be discussing about how to write a program to print Internal Varsity Number Square Pattern. In this pattern, there are n*n rows and columns are present.First, We will check if i == 0 or j == 0 or j == cols-1 or i == rows – 1, this condition is satisfied, then we will print the border with number “3”. Otherwise, Sequence of a number staring from 1.So, User have to enter a single value, that will be determine as a number of rows and columns of the pattern. With the help of “for loop”, we will print the Internal Varsity Number Square Pattern.

Python Program for Printing Internal Varsity Number Square Pattern
Working:
Step 1. Start

Step 2. Take number of rows input from the user and store it in any variable (‘rows’ in this case).

Step 3. Take number of coloum input from the user and store it in any variable (‘cols’ in this case).

Step 4. Run a loop ‘i’ number of times to iterate through all the rows which is Starting from i=0 to rows.

Step 5. Run a nested loop inside the main loop for printing spaces which is starting from j=0 to cols.

Step 6. Check if i == 0 or j == 0 or j == cols-1 or i == rows – 1, this condition is satisfied, then print “3”.

Step 7. Otherwise print “i”.

Step 8. Move to the next line by printing a new line using print() function.

Stop 10. Stop

Python Program:
rows = int(input("Enter the Number of rows: "))
cols = int(input("Enter the Number of cols: "))

for i in range(0, rows):
    for j in range(0, cols):
        if i == 0 or j == 0 or j == cols-1 or i == rows - 1:
            print("3", end="")
        else:
            print(i, end="")
    print()
