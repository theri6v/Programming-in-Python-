In this Python Program, we will be discussing about how to write a program to print Mirrored Rhombus Star Pattern. A rhombus is a quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. In rhombus pattern, there are n rows and same n numbers of column are present. So, User have to enter a single value, that will be determine as a number of rows and columns of the pattern. With the help of “for loop” and “Nested For Loop” , we will print the Mirrored Rhombus Star Pattern.

Python Program for Printing Mirrored Rhombus Star Pattern
Working:
Step 1. Start

Step 2. Take number of rows as input from the user and stored it into num.

Step 3. Run a for loop starting from 0 to user entered num value.

Step 4. Run a loop ‘i’ number of times to iterate through all the rows which is Starting from i=0 to num. 

Step 5. Run a nested loop inside the main loop for printing spaces which is starting from j=0 to num-i-1.

Step 6. Run a nested loop inside the main loop for printing stars which is starting from j=0 to num.

Step 7. Move to the next line by printing a new line using print() function.

Stop 8. Stop

Python Program:

num = int(input("Enter the number:"))

for i in range(0, num):
    for j in range(0, num-i-1):
        print(" ", end="")
    for j in range(0, num):
        print("*", end="")
    print()
