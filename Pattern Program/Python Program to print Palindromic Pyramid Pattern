The numbers whose reverse is same as the original number are termed as Palindrome.

For Example: A number 12321 is a palindromic number because its reverse is 12321 which is equal to the original number.

Here we have to print the Pyramid of Palindromes. The number of elements in each row increases as we go down.

Palindromic Pyramid Pattern
Algorithm
Take n as input for number of rows
Call palindromicPyramid(n)
palindromicPyramid(rows):
Traverse i from i to rows+1  and do step 2 to step 10 (Outer loop for each row)
Traverse j for i to rows+1 and do step 3 (1St inner loop to print blank spaces)
print single blank space ” “
End of 1St inner loop
Traverse j for i to i+1 and do step 6 (2nd inner loop to print first half of palindrome)
print j
End of 2nd inner loop
Traverse j for i-1 to 0 and do step 9 (3rd inner loop to print second half of the palindrome)
print j
End of 3rd inner loop
End of Outer Loop
Python Code

#function for printing palindromic Pyramid
def palindromicPyramid(rows):
    #outer loop for each row
    for i in range(0,rows+1):
        #1st inner loop for printing blank spaces in each row
        for j in range(i,rows+1):
                print(”  “,end=” “)
        #2nd inner loop for printing increasing half in each row
        for j in range(1,i+1):
            print(j,end=” “)
         #3rd inner loop for printing decreasing half in each row
        for j in range(i-1,0,-1):
            print(j,end=” “)
        #print new line character for next row
        print()
                
#input
n=int(input(“Enter the number of rows :”))
#function call
palindromicPyramid(n)


Output:

Enter the number of rows :8
                           
                        1 
                      1 2 1 
                    1 2 3 2 1 
                  1 2 3 4 3 2 1 
                1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 
              1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 
            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
