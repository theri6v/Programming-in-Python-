Nth Term of a Fibonacci Series
On this page we will learn how to Find the Nth Term of a Fibonacci Series  in Python.

Using two Different Methods

Using Loop
Using Recursion
Input : 6
Output : 5
Explanation : Fibonacci series is the sum of the previous two terms, so if we enter 6 as the input in the program, so we should get 5 as the output.
Factorial of a Number in Python
Method 1 : Using Loop
Algorithm
Start
If n is less then 2 return n
Initialize a array with value 0 & 1 respectively named fs
Use  a for loop to iterate between range 1 to n using variable i
For each iteration append the sum of current element and previous element to fs
Return the Nth element of fs
Python Program to find Nth Term of a Fibonacci Series
Python Code
Run
def Fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    fs = [0, 1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        fs.append(fs[i] + fs[i - 1])
    return fs[n]


n = 6
print(Fibonacci(n-1))
Output :

5
Method 2 : Using Recursion
Algorithm
Start by calling the function for n
If n is less then 2 return n
If n>0:
Return the sum of recursive call for same function with value  n – 1  &  n – 2
Python Code
Run
def fib(n):
	if n < 2:
		return n
	return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


n = 6
print(fib(n-1))
Output :

5
