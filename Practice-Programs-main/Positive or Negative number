Check if a Number is Positive and Negative in Python
Given an integer input, the objective is check whether the given integer is Positive or Negative. In order to do so we have the following methods,

Method 1: Using Brute Force
Method 2: Using Nested if-else Statements
Method 3: Using ternary operator
We’ll discuss each method in-depth in the section below.

**Method 1: Using Brute Force

This method uses Brute Force to check whether a given integer is Positive or Negative.


num = 15
if num > 0:
    print('Positive')
elif num < 0:
    print('Negative')
else:
    print('Zero')
	
Output:

Positive

Algorithm
This method uses Brute Force to check whether a given integer is Positive or Negative.

Algorithm for the above code is as follows,

Initialize num as 15
If the num > 0: it is a positive number.
If the num < 0: it is a Negative number.
Else the number has to be zero itself


**Method 2: Using Nested if-else Statements

This method uses a nested if-else Statements to check whether a given number is Positive or Negative.


num = 15
if num>=0:
    if num==0:
        print('Zero')
    else:
        print("Positive")
else:
    print("Negative")
Output
Positive
Algorithm
This method uses a nested if-else Statements to check whether a given number is Positive or Negative.

Algorithm for the above code is as follows,

Initialize num as 15
If the num >= 0
If num == 0 : num is zero
Else number has to be positive 
Else the number has to be negative



**Method 3: Using Ternary Operator
This method uses a ternary operator to check whether a number is Positive or Negative.

Ternary Operator Syntax
( Condition ) ? ( if True : Action) : ( if False : Action) ;


num =15
print("Positive" if num>=0 else "Negative")
Output
Positive
Algorithm
This method uses a ternary operator in Python to check whether a number is Positive or Negative.

For a user input num

Return “Positive” if num>=0 else “Negative”.
Algorithm for the above code is as follows,

Initialize num as 15.
print the output using ternary operator in python using print () function.
